LOTR displays a persistent view of your Vim `:registers` in a sidebar window.

== Commands

* `:LOTROpen`
* `:LOTRClose`
* `:LOTRToggle` also available through `<PLUG>LOTRToggle` which is mapped to `<leader>cr` by default.

== Within the LOTR window:

* `q` closes the LOTR window
* `<space>` toggles zoom mode
* `<cr>` returns to the prior window
